# Stencilizer (made on Angular 4)
Just a fun, experimental image "stencilizer" app

# What the app does?

The app creates a [stencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil) from a give picture.
You can test it using my pictures, uploading a picture of yours, or taking a snapshot with your webcam.
You can try it [here](http://themissingtile.com/portfolio/stencilizer/).

# Stack + technology

Originally made on Angular 2, the app has now been updated to Angular 4. 
The app uses SVG, canvas and some experimental browser features, like the FileReader (to read your pictures without uploading on a server) and the WebRTC MediaStream (to use your webcam and take snapshots).

# Made on Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
